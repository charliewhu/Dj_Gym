App to keep track of workouts.


Initial (Log as you go):
    User can log Workouts as they go.
    RoutineDays consist of multiple RoutineItems/Exercises
    RoutineItems consist of various Sets / Reps / Weight / RIR

Add RoutineDay --> Add RoutineItem --> Add Sets

    Thoughts on completion:
        - forgot to add User to Workout. This is due to building out all models in advance. DONE
        - better way to add Exercise to Workout. HTMX required to add on-page. NOT ADDING
        - potentially add dependent dropdown to Exercise selection for better UX. DONE
        - potentially add javascript to reorder exercises. NOT ADDING


Phase 2 (Pre-plan eg 4-week Routine):
    User can make many Routines
    Routines consist of multiple RoutineWeeks
    RoutineWeeks consist of multiple RoutineDays
    RoutineDays consist of multiple RoutineItems/Exercises
    RoutineItems consist of various Sets / Reps / Weight / RIR

CHANGED to:
    Pre-workout questionnaire
    Workout has multiple WorkoutExercises
    WorkoutExercises have multiple WorkoutExerciseSets
    Generate Sets for that Workout

        - Max effort (RIR)
        - Number of lifts (NOL)  
        - Exertion Load (EL) - ROM * sum(sets) * e^-0.215(set * setreps * repno)
        - E1RM - Epley Formula = weight * (1 + reps/30)

FOR USER Questionnaire + 1RM calculation? When user ends workout (save IF is_active=False)
