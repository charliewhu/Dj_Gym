App to keep track of workouts.


Initial (Log as you go):
    User can log Workouts as they go.
    RoutineDays consist of multiple RoutineItems/Exercises
    RoutineItems consist of various Sets / Reps / Weight / RIR

Add RoutineDay --> Add RoutineItem --> Add Sets

    Thoughts on completion:
        - forgot to add User to Workout. This is due to building out all models in advance. DONE
        - better way to add Exercise to Workout. HTMX required to add on-page. NOT ADDING
        - potentially add dependent dropdown to Exercise selection for better UX. DONE
        - potentially add javascript to reorder exercises. NOT ADDING


Phase 2 (Pre-plan eg 4-week Routine):
    User can make many Routines
    Routines consist of multiple RoutineWeeks
    RoutineWeeks consist of multiple RoutineDays
    RoutineDays consist of multiple RoutineItems/Exercises
    RoutineItems consist of various Sets / Reps / Weight / RIR

CHANGED to:
    Pre-workout questionnaire
    Workout has multiple WorkoutExercises
    WorkoutExercises have multiple WorkoutExerciseSets
    Generate Sets for that Workout

Features:
    - Readiness Questionnaire
        - Sleep
        - Energy
        - Mood
        - Soreness
        - Stress
        - Nutrition
        - Hydration
        - Weight
    - Stats
        - Number of hard sets (RIR <= 3)
        - Relative intensity (%) of Workout
        - Max intensity (%)
        - Relative effort (RIR)
        - Max effort (RIR)
        - Number of lifts (NOL)  
        - Exertion Load (EL) - ROM * sum(sets) * e^-0.215(set * setreps * repno)
        - E1RM - Epley Formula = weight * (1 + reps/30)

FOR USER Questionnaire + 1RM calculation? When user ends workout (save IF is_active=False)

Phase 3a (App generates based on User inputted details):
    User can specify which type of Cycle the Routine is
    User can specify how many Weeks the Routine has
    User can specify how many Days per Week the Routine has 
    User can specify which Exercises to do on each Day 
    User can specify ProgressionScheme 
        - this impacts how the RoutineItems change each Week


Phase 3b (App generates based on User questionnaire)


Phase 4 (User can track weight and physical stats):


Notes on set adjustments and workout generation 28/1/22:
    (User)
    Phase:
    Bodybuilding - if no rep maxes exist - work 8-12 reps to 3-1RIR
    Powerbuilding - if no rep maxes exist - work to 3-1RIR
    PL Hypertrophy - if no rep maxes exist - work 6-10 reps to 3-1RIR
    PL Strength 1 - if no rep maxes exist - work 3-6 reps to 5-2RIR
    PL Strength 2 - if no rep maxes exist - work 2-5 reps to 4-2RIR
    Peaking - if no rep maxes exist - work 1-3 reps to 2RIR

    Periodization:


    Modality:
    Top Sets (1x5 @2RIR, load drop 3x5)
    Straight Sets (5x5 with a max RPE boundary)
    Rep drop Sets (8,7,5 all @2RIR)
    Technique Sets (2-5 reps @ 4-5RIR)
    Ladder Sets (Sets like 9,2,8,3,7,4)

    (Exercises)
    Force:
    Horizontal Push
    Vertical Push
    Horizontal Pull
    Vertical Pull
    Leg Press
    Hip Hinge
    Lateral Raise
    Isolation (Bicep Curl, Tricep Ext, Calf Raise)

    Muscle Group:

    PL Purpose:
    Squat
    Bench
    Deadlift

    PL Tier:
    T1 exercises are the competition exercises.\
    T2 exercises are close variations of the main lifts. \
    T3 exercises develop the musculature eg. quads for squats. \
    Other exercises develop supplementary muscles
